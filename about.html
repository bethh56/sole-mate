        <p class="ml-5 mr-5 pr-5 pl-5">It's cold, but it's beautiful. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Share it with a friend. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>
